This project is a smart fridge that allows people to manage their fridge inventory to reduce food waste. It can be used commercially (e.g., by restaurants) or for individual households.

## Next Steps/Future Extensions
* Add a database to the backend to store fridge contents
* AI to take photos instead of manually inputting information.
* Either donate or use foods with upcoming best before dates in recipes.
* Add a pantry (My eFridge and ePantry).
